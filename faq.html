			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

			<h2>How can I pay?</h2>
			<p>
				I currently only accept cash and checks. I am working on setting up credit card payments. You will receive an invoice at the end of all related visits and repairs with the cost of all visits and parts. If you prefer, you may pay at the end of each visit.
			</p>

			<h2>How will I receive an invoice?</h2>
			<p>
				I can send them via email or text or deliver them by mail or by hand. If you have a preference for how to receive them, please let me know.
			</p>

			<h2>How long will repairs take?</h2>
			<p>
				Depending on the complexity, they could take anywhere from an hour to a couple of hours. If I estimate a repair to take longer than that, I will recommend you to another business that can help you, as I am a full-time student living on campus.
			</p>

			<h2>Where will you repair my device?</h2>
			<p>
				I will do my best to conduct all repairs on-site, but, if space is limited, I may request to continue the repair off-site and bring it back when finished.
			</p>

			<h2>How much do repairs cost?</h2>
			<p>
				The final cost of a repair varies. The client is responsible for the cost of labor ($20 per hour, half hour minimum) and parts. You will receive an itemized invoice of all parts and labor following the last visit.
			</p>

			<h2 id="faq-location">Where are you located?</h2>
			<p>
				At the moment, I am a full-time student at the University of Montana in Missoula, MT. I can do visits by appointment in Missoula's surrounding communities within a thirty-minute drive from campus. This includes East Missoula, Bonner, Lolo, and Frenchtown.
